# Restaurant_Database
A collection of components for a database which stores local restaurants and their attributes. This database was created a personal project to catalogue restaurants in my area to help my girlfriend and I decide where to eat :)

This repository contains the following four files:

1. Restaurants_DB_ERD - An ERD diagram detailing the database structure
2. Restaurants_DB - An Access Database file containing the full Database completed with forms and a dashboard
3. Create_Tables - A text file containing all of the SQL written to create the database tables
4. Query_Tables - A text file containing all of the SQL written to create the database queries
